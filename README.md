# Python

Network scanning helps to detect all the active hosts on a network and maps them to their IP addresses. Network scanners send a packet or ping to every possible IP address and wait for a response to determine the status of the devices

Syntax:

python3 NetorkScanner.py IP
python3 NetorkScanner.py IP/CIDR
